However, I noticed that a lot of the content had been deleted or removed, making up about a quarter of all my posts. So now I've implemented the ability to retrieve this information from pushshift and the wayback machine, and it works very well. For reference, I downloaded about 3500 posts from 5+ years back and only had around 200 fail.\\n\\nLet me know how my code looks and if there's anything I could improve on.

A few years after that, .NET became dominant after ASP, but the core three were still more or less the same.

VB was useful, but wasn't well-respected, perl was mostly for reporting or other small utilities, and rexx was super-cool, but didn't have a huge reputation on unix & windows.\\n   * late-90s: Perl established the legitimacy of interpreted languages for backend application development.  Few people had heard of python by this time. \\n   * early-00s: many people started looking for a light-weight alternative to the heavy boilerplate of Java and something more readable, and with stricter tyuping than Perl - and started using Python. Python was very capable, jython looked promising.  Given that the Perl community really made the case for interpreted languages to be taken seriously - there was an *enormous* amount of hostility towards Python from the Perl community.\\n   * late-00s: python's future seemed questionable given the enthusiasm and rapid growth of the ruby-community once rails took off.  Python's migration to v3 was a bit of disaster but it finally hit the tipping point fairly suddenly right at the middle of the decade which really opened it up for growth.\\n   * 10s: data science began taking off and python was the preferred language, python got picked up by a lot of schools, ruby declined, and the trajectory was set.\\n\\nEDIT; fixed some typos, added a bit\",\n",

By the mid 90s, Pascal was viewed as an inferior language for teaching OO concepts, and there was some rub with Borland at the time too. At that time, CS departments shifted to where C++ would have been the language of the curriculum, but some did pick up Java early. By the late 90s, Java was the curriculum language for practically every CS department used.\\n\\nIf CS professors had seen Python as the alternative to Pascal, we’d be having a different conversation.',\n",

This is a step towards the threading model that Perl introduced experimentally in 5.6.0 (2000) and [supported in 5.8.0](https://perldoc.perl.org/threads#DESCRIPTION) (2002).

Additionally, forcing it hurts python as a scripting language, I for one don’t need types on a 60 line ETL with pandas. \\n\\nI used to be a maintainer for a 200 kloc python codebase. It was well over a decade old and developed by dozens of people across about a dozen companies. A project of that scale needs to very explicitly declare interfaces otherwise it becomes nearly impossible to reason about the codebase. Specifically, having well specified return types means that forgetting to handle None-returns is not an issue anymore. \\n\\nThe overhead of reading generic syntax, like “this function takes an iterator of T and a function that takes T and returns U, returning an iterator of U”, is nothing compared to trying to figure that out from reading the function or explaining it in a doc comment. The first few times you see it it does take a bit longer, but that goes away. \\n\\nPython will likely never have a strong enough type system to replace all testing. However, it can replace some testing when combined with mypy. If your types are well specified, you can throw out all the tests around “Does this function do the right thing if I give it the wrong types?”, “Does this function handle None?”, etc. If you start to use prototypes and generic constraints, you can use mypy to check that you are composing correctly. \\n\\nThe big advantages is for IDEs and tooling. The TypeVar approach is a nightmare for tools to handle. Being able to get “this function takes T and U and returns T” from the signature should help speed up things quite a bit. \\n\\nIn the future, I could see mypy being integrated into python and allowing an opt-in “strict typing” mode which increases startup time but allows python to generate better machine code or just automatically create the guard code for incorrect types for you. Alternatively, this would open up ahead of time compilation, which might enable you to figure out everything in interpreted mode then compile for production.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The core answer for me is if I could replace python with statically typed similarish language with same library ecosystem I likely would. Python is used by many groups for variety of reasons. I work on large production numerical/ml libraries in python. Python dominates ml ecosystem and most other languages are worth little consideration for products that use deep learning. At same time typing is still very useful as both form of documentation and for making refactors/changes in large codebases safer.\\n\\nAs for your linter point I value linters strongly. My current codebase requires code to lint check, pass documentation rules, pass type checker, and test coverage rules. Type checking does not replace testing. I consider it to be stronger then typical linter and both linters/type checkers I find very valuable in refactors and following larger codebases \\n\\nI think this feature does make following generics a good deal more straight forward. The current way of doing it makes generic methods of class very ambiguous and easy to confuse generic function in a class vs generic class’s function which look almost same but mean two different things. Python is also rather weird in that almost no other language with generic has comparable syntax today. I’ve coded in bunch of languages to some degree and can’t think of any language with similar way of doing generics as python for defining type variables. I think for developers that write generic functions new syntax will be more friendly to use and follow.\\n\\nLastly I would not consider conciseness a goal of python. The new syntax is more concise then existing way of defining TypeVar for 1 function but even if it mildly longer that would not be main consideration for me. There are parts of python that look like pseudo code but there are many ways it does not optimize for conciseness like custom operators. Haskell is much more concise and dense language used by a couple companies. J is even more extreme concision language but I’d consider J to be pretty difficult to read and very special case.',\n",

I try to be clear and honest about Ruff\\'s strengths and weaknesses -- there are some cursory answers in the [FAQ](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/#how-does-ruff-compare-to-flake8) RE comparisons to other tools -- but since the article mostly talked strengths, I\\'m happy to suggest a few \"reasons not to use Ruff\". I think about them a lot :)\\n\\n1. **No support for custom rules or plugins.** This is Ruff\\'s biggest limitation right now. E.g., Flake8 has a robust plugin system, so anyone can extend Flake8 with custom rules. Ruff doesn\\'t support that. (I\\'d like to support plugins in the future, but we\\'re not working on it right now.)\\n2. **\"Less powerful\" static analysis.** Compared to Pylint, Ruff is \"less powerful\" right now. It doesn\\'t look across files, it can\\'t catch things like \"wrong number of arguments provided to a function\", it doesn\\'t really do any branch analysis, and so on. It\\'s similar to Flake8, in that way. I\\'m certain that Ruff will improve here, but if you straight-up replace Pylint with Ruff, you might feel like you\\'re missing certain kinds of analyses that Ruff can\\'t yet support.\\n3. **Less stable / more churn.** We still haven\\'t published a \"stable release\". We\\'re on version 0.0.260 or so. To be honest, we used to be a little more brazen about publishing breaking changes -- now that we have a bunch of projects relying on us, we\\'re pretty careful and hesitant. But, it\\'s true that you\\'d expect a tool like Flake8 or Pylint that\\'s been around for years to give you less churn on configuration, diagnostics, etc.\\n4. **You\\'re happy with your linter.** If Ruff\\'s strengths don\\'t resonate with you, that\\'s of course fine too. (Although you might be surprised. I think there are a lot of happy Ruff users who wouldn\\'t have expected a \"faster linter\" to be impactful to them before they tried Ruff.)\\n\\nI hope that the hype around Ruff is just a sign that we\\'re building something people like to use (though in reality I\\'m sure it\\'s also luck). I get a ton of motivation out of reading comments like those in this thread. From my perspective, I really just try to focus on building out the tool itself, supporting contributors, and being responsive to issues.',\n",

It’s more important to me that it’s stable, well documented and easy to use than infinitely configurable and fast. \\n\\nAnd before someone tells me they figured it out no problem, you have to understand that I’m an idiot, and its important to me to have idiot-proof tools. Ruff is not yet idiot proof, and looking at their docs and integrations it has a good bit to go before it is.',\n",

My job now puts me on the worst, mobile connection in the area. Like pi-hole or UBlock Origin, a scraper can let me get just what I need, transform it into a compact view, and send it over weak connection.\\n\\n3. Related is bypassing buggy UI. One example is BibleGateway which I pay for to use with my sites (see profile). I needed Spanish verses since I was serving Hispanic community, too. It had some feature that gives you all English or all Spanish translations if you ever pick one. Hard to go back. On such sites, it’s easier to use a URL generator to reliably get to content you want. I also scraped out and spliced the key content into a minimalist, HTML page served over Flask. Got *way* faster!\\n\\n4. That brings us to custom UI’s. One of old concepts for Web 3.0 was the provide data, we connect to it, and transform and view it however we want. You can approximate this with scraping combined with console, GUI, or web libraries. \\n\\n5. Old one is getting pricing and availability of something across markets. Comparison shopping. Many stores seem to realize making that easy, like with an API, can lead people to competition’s better deals. Others have restrictive API’s but no restrictions on main site. You might have to custom-make scrapers for sites that didn’t try to present the info in a machine readable way. You can also sell or trade on this kind of info.\\n\\n6. Site uptime monitor. Scrapers can make for a basic monitor. You don’t need to know networking. \\n\\nThere’s just a few things I’ve done or tried to do in the past month while learning Python.',\n",

I'm super happy with the results.\\n\\nTo recap, this program backs up all of your saved posts on Reddit, obtaining media such as Reddit galleries, Imgur albums, gifs, videos, etc. It stores a local log of all of the files downloaded/skipped.\\n\\nSince last posting, I've added the ability to load your entire saved post record using information provided by Reddit. However, I noticed that a lot of the content had been deleted or removed, making up about a quarter of all my posts. So now I've implemented the ability to retrieve this information from pushshift and the wayback machine, and it works very well. For reference, I downloaded about 3500 posts from 5+ years back and only had around 200 fail.\\n\\nLet me know how my code looks and if there's anything I could improve on. Thanks!\\n\\n[https://github.com/aeluro1/geddit](https://github.com/aeluro1/geddit)\",\n",

VB was useful, but wasn't well-respected, perl was mostly for reporting or other small utilities, and rexx was super-cool, but didn't have a huge reputation on unix & windows.\\n   * late-90s: Perl established the legitimacy of interpreted languages for backend application development.  Few people had heard of python by this time. \\n   * early-00s: many people started looking for a light-weight alternative to the heavy boilerplate of Java and something more readable, and with stricter tyuping than Perl - and started using Python. Python was very capable, jython looked promising.  Given that the Perl community really made the case for interpreted languages to be taken seriously - there was an *enormous* amount of hostility towards Python from the Perl community.\\n   * late-00s: python's future seemed questionable given the enthusiasm and rapid growth of the ruby-community once rails took off.  Python's migration to v3 was a bit of disaster but it finally hit the tipping point fairly suddenly right at the middle of the decade which really opened it up for growth.\\n   * 10s: data science began taking off and python was the preferred language, python got picked up by a lot of schools, ruby declined, and the trajectory was set.\\n\\nEDIT; fixed some typos, added a bit\",\n",

I only used it because I could not stand Perl.  It was viewed as more of a toy language for a while, since it started out as an educational tool.  \\n\\nAlso, during that time C++ was king and Java was the new kid on the block.  We were excited to use Java and things like RMI so we wouldn't have to use Corba and C++.   No one really believed the write-once run anywhere sales pitch.  Java was REAL slow when it first came out.  Memory was tighter back then so giant JVM sizes could take down a machine.  Took a while for Java to hit it's stride.  Once BEA came on the scene with Weblogic then stuff took off.  J2EE blew Java up big time.\\n\\nSo, Python was not in anyone's minds at that time.  I was even seen as a weirdo for using it.  Took an act of god to get it installed on a BSD system at my place of employment at the time.\",\n",

Also the normal C++ `std::mutex` can't synchronize across different processes.\\n\\nSo effectively, if you had an existing thread-safe C++ library and wanted to use it concurrently from multiple Python threads, you were forced to choose between:\\n\\n1) run everything in one process, with the GIL massively limiting the possible concurrency\\n\\n2) Use multiprocessing run a separate copy of the C++ library in each process. This multiplies our memory consumption (for us, that's often ~15GB) with the number of cores (so keeping a modern CPU busy would take 480GB of RAM)\\n\\n3) Essentially re-write the C++ library to use custom allocators and custom locks everywhere, so that it can place the 15 GB data in shared memory.\\n\\nNow with Python 3.12 with GIL-per-subinterpreter, I think we'll finally be able to use all CPU cores concurrently without massively increasing our memory usage or C++ code complexity.\",\n",

Additionally, forcing it hurts python as a scripting language, I for one don’t need types on a 60 line ETL with pandas. \\n\\nI used to be a maintainer for a 200 kloc python codebase. It was well over a decade old and developed by dozens of people across about a dozen companies. A project of that scale needs to very explicitly declare interfaces otherwise it becomes nearly impossible to reason about the codebase. Specifically, having well specified return types means that forgetting to handle None-returns is not an issue anymore. \\n\\nThe overhead of reading generic syntax, like “this function takes an iterator of T and a function that takes T and returns U, returning an iterator of U”, is nothing compared to trying to figure that out from reading the function or explaining it in a doc comment. The first few times you see it it does take a bit longer, but that goes away. \\n\\nPython will likely never have a strong enough type system to replace all testing. However, it can replace some testing when combined with mypy. If your types are well specified, you can throw out all the tests around “Does this function do the right thing if I give it the wrong types?”, “Does this function handle None?”, etc. If you start to use prototypes and generic constraints, you can use mypy to check that you are composing correctly. \\n\\nThe big advantages is for IDEs and tooling. The TypeVar approach is a nightmare for tools to handle. Being able to get “this function takes T and U and returns T” from the signature should help speed up things quite a bit. \\n\\nIn the future, I could see mypy being integrated into python and allowing an opt-in “strict typing” mode which increases startup time but allows python to generate better machine code or just automatically create the guard code for incorrect types for you. Alternatively, this would open up ahead of time compilation, which might enable you to figure out everything in interpreted mode then compile for production.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The core answer for me is if I could replace python with statically typed similarish language with same library ecosystem I likely would. Python is used by many groups for variety of reasons. I work on large production numerical/ml libraries in python. Python dominates ml ecosystem and most other languages are worth little consideration for products that use deep learning. At same time typing is still very useful as both form of documentation and for making refactors/changes in large codebases safer.\\n\\nAs for your linter point I value linters strongly. My current codebase requires code to lint check, pass documentation rules, pass type checker, and test coverage rules. Type checking does not replace testing. I consider it to be stronger then typical linter and both linters/type checkers I find very valuable in refactors and following larger codebases \\n\\nI think this feature does make following generics a good deal more straight forward. The current way of doing it makes generic methods of class very ambiguous and easy to confuse generic function in a class vs generic class’s function which look almost same but mean two different things. Python is also rather weird in that almost no other language with generic has comparable syntax today. I’ve coded in bunch of languages to some degree and can’t think of any language with similar way of doing generics as python for defining type variables. I think for developers that write generic functions new syntax will be more friendly to use and follow.\\n\\nLastly I would not consider conciseness a goal of python. The new syntax is more concise then existing way of defining TypeVar for 1 function but even if it mildly longer that would not be main consideration for me. There are parts of python that look like pseudo code but there are many ways it does not optimize for conciseness like custom operators. Haskell is much more concise and dense language used by a couple companies. J is even more extreme concision language but I’d consider J to be pretty difficult to read and very special case.',\n",

       "  'body': \"TL;DR:\\n\\nA linter is a tool that checks your code for mistakes and style issues. PyLint, Flake8, Black, and Blue are popular Python linters. Ruff is a new tool that can replace multiple linters (and also soon [format your code like Black/Blue](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1904).\\n\\n\\nLong form:\\nA linter is a tool that analyzes your code for potential errors, bugs, and stylistic issues (like [black](https://github.com/psf/black). It checks your code against a bunch of rules someone made (like Black, that is PEP8 compliant)\\n\\nIn Python, there are several popular linters such as PyLint, Flake8, and Black. These linters perform various checks on your code, including syntax errors, variable names, code formatting, and code complexity.\\n\\n- PyLint analyzes your Python code for errors and style issues, and assigns a score based on the quality of your code.\\n- Flake8 checks your code for style issues, syntax errors, and potential bugs.\\n- Black and Blue are Python code formatters that automatically reformats your code \\n- MyPy, while not a linter in the traditional sense, focuses specifically on type-checking and does not perform general code quality checks like PyLint or Flake8.\\n\\nWhat's interesting is not just Ruff's ability to outperform many of these tools, but its ability to take your pipeline of 5+ tools to do these things and use one thing (Ruff) instead.\\n\\nRuff is also aspiring to be a code formatter like Black/Blue with some configuration allowed. So, maybe soon, we can see another tool replaced by Ruff :) (https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1904)\",\n",

I try to be clear and honest about Ruff\\'s strengths and weaknesses -- there are some cursory answers in the [FAQ](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/#how-does-ruff-compare-to-flake8) RE comparisons to other tools -- but since the article mostly talked strengths, I\\'m happy to suggest a few \"reasons not to use Ruff\". I think about them a lot :)\\n\\n1. **No support for custom rules or plugins.** This is Ruff\\'s biggest limitation right now. E.g., Flake8 has a robust plugin system, so anyone can extend Flake8 with custom rules. Ruff doesn\\'t support that. (I\\'d like to support plugins in the future, but we\\'re not working on it right now.)\\n2. **\"Less powerful\" static analysis.** Compared to Pylint, Ruff is \"less powerful\" right now. It doesn\\'t look across files, it can\\'t catch things like \"wrong number of arguments provided to a function\", it doesn\\'t really do any branch analysis, and so on. It\\'s similar to Flake8, in that way. I\\'m certain that Ruff will improve here, but if you straight-up replace Pylint with Ruff, you might feel like you\\'re missing certain kinds of analyses that Ruff can\\'t yet support.\\n3. **Less stable / more churn.** We still haven\\'t published a \"stable release\". We\\'re on version 0.0.260 or so. To be honest, we used to be a little more brazen about publishing breaking changes -- now that we have a bunch of projects relying on us, we\\'re pretty careful and hesitant. But, it\\'s true that you\\'d expect a tool like Flake8 or Pylint that\\'s been around for years to give you less churn on configuration, diagnostics, etc.\\n4. **You\\'re happy with your linter.** If Ruff\\'s strengths don\\'t resonate with you, that\\'s of course fine too. (Although you might be surprised. I think there are a lot of happy Ruff users who wouldn\\'t have expected a \"faster linter\" to be impactful to them before they tried Ruff.)\\n\\nI hope that the hype around Ruff is just a sign that we\\'re building something people like to use (though in reality I\\'m sure it\\'s also luck). I get a ton of motivation out of reading comments like those in this thread. From my perspective, I really just try to focus on building out the tool itself, supporting contributors, and being responsive to issues.',\n",

It\\'s still faster than any one of those tools, and it\\'s only one dependency.\\n* The maintainer seems like a pleasant person who\\'s willing to work with the community and enjoys what he\\'s doing. Look through the issue tracker on flake8. 90% of them are closed and locked to contributors after a single reply of \"use the issue tracker\". When you google a problem you\\'re having with flake8, the most likely top result is a closed issue that just says \"you clearly didn\\'t search the issue tracker\".

Charlie on the other hand is releasing several times a week and actively engaging on trying to solve issues without writing people off or shutting them down.\\n* Related to the last one, flake8 has some issues that they won\\'t fix seemingly just out of stubbornness, regardless of how much of a problem they cause to the community.\\n   * They refuse to support pyproject.toml configuration despite overwhelming desire for it, and shut down threads for it with \"search the issue tracker\".

       "  'body': 'My first project was a scraper. Wrote my own library for it to learn requests and text manipulation. Then, I had to do another and another. I’m probably just gonna re-learn BeautifulSoup cuz it’s so recurring. For why, I’d say they fall into a few categories:\\n\\n1. I wanted a copy of all the best submissions and comments on my favorite tech site (Lobste.rs) at one point. That was originally to experiment with better search features using local software. A third-party site with same content might facilitate better searching. Or ranking, curation, etc.\\n\\n2. Many sites are bloated. They can be slow at home. My job now puts me on the worst, mobile connection in the area. Like pi-hole or UBlock Origin, a scraper can let me get just what I need, transform it into a compact view, and send it over weak connection.\\n\\n3. Related is bypassing buggy UI. One example is BibleGateway which I pay for to use with my sites (see profile). I needed Spanish verses since I was serving Hispanic community, too. It had some feature that gives you all English or all Spanish translations if you ever pick one. Hard to go back. On such sites, it’s easier to use a URL generator to reliably get to content you want. I also scraped out and spliced the key content into a minimalist, HTML page served over Flask. Got *way* faster!\\n\\n4. That brings us to custom UI’s. One of old concepts for Web 3.0 was the provide data, we connect to it, and transform and view it however we want. You can approximate this with scraping combined with console, GUI, or web libraries. \\n\\n5. Old one is getting pricing and availability of something across markets. Comparison shopping. Many stores seem to realize making that easy, like with an API, can lead people to competition’s better deals. Others have restrictive API’s but no restrictions on main site. You might have to custom-make scrapers for sites that didn’t try to present the info in a machine readable way. You can also sell or trade on this kind of info.\\n\\n6. Site uptime monitor. Scrapers can make for a basic monitor. You don’t need to know networking. \\n\\nThere’s just a few things I’ve done or tried to do in the past month while learning Python.',\n",
