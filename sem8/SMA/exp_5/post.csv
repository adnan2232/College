I know the course is not top notch and can be improved a lot but honestly I hope you like it as it is. I've set the lowest price I could set for it on Udemy and I'm just grateful that it helped cover my blog hosting fees over the last 3 years.

12fzdu2,aeluro1,88efmodhn,12,370,top week,Comprehensive Reddit Saved Posts Downloader - retrieves almost all content ever saved,"Hi all, I made a post about this a couple of days ago, but I've made some pretty massive changes since then and I wanted to share it again. I'm super happy with the results.

To recap, this program backs up all of your saved posts on Reddit, obtaining media such as Reddit galleries, Imgur albums, gifs, videos, etc. It stores a local log of all of the files downloaded/skipped.

Since last posting, I've added the ability to load your entire saved post record using information provided by Reddit. However, I noticed that a lot of the content had been deleted or removed, making up about a quarter of all my posts. So now I've implemented the ability to retrieve this information from pushshift and the wayback machine, and it works very well. For reference, I downloaded about 3500 posts from 5+ years back and only had around 200 fail.

Let me know how my code looks and if there's anything I could improve on. Thanks!

12dfdq1,BeingHeldAgainstWill,3brony28,43,318,top week,SpotiFile : Music scraping made easy," 

I made a neat tool to scrape songs (with GUI).

[GitHub Link](https://github.com/Michael-K-Stein/SpotiFile)

All you need to do is install the dependencies (""pip install -r ./requirements""), and then ""python [main.py](https://main.py/)"". It's that easy!

##This tool is mainly aimed at developers looking to create datasets to train ML models.

SpotiFile will open a GUI which lets you enter a playlist, album, artist, or user profile link and download all the relevant songs. This will also download all the metadata of the song, including the time-synced lyrics!

If you use the tool, please give the repo a star :)
And please tell me how to improve the code quality!

Enjoy!",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/12dfdq1/spotifile_music_scraping_made_easy/,2023-04-06 10:11:05,python,t5_2qh0y

Mainly used pandas, using the dataset of internal Enron emails from their collapse that was released during criminal proceedings.

Also used the NRC Emotion Lexicon.
