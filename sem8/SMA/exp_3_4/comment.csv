jflbch7,12glkw4,t3_12glkw4,"I was a web developer between 2000 and 2010, and at that time, although Python was a better language than e.g. PHP, this latter was much better for web development. PHP was designed as a templating language (for C++), and coming from this angle, it was just simply better equiped for the web from the very beginning. In the meantime, web technology has evolved a lot, and also the Python ecosystem is way better than it was 10-20 years ago.

The same stands for Java and C#. The Python ecosystem was just simply not competitive against these behemots (in the early 2000ies).

A programming language has to find a sweet spot on the market to be successful. And while Guido van Rossum and others have been working on the numerical capabilities of Python since 1995, Python started to enjoy this benefit only after the launch of Pandas (I guess).",2023-04-09 17:13:45,2,8hi6986p,Asleep-Dress-3578
jfmk972,12glkw4,t1_jflbch7,"Adding on to this from my POV, early web in the early 2000's was Java/JSP if you were enterprise, ASP if you were a Windows shop, and LAMp(hp) if you were startups aka poor aka bleeding edge.  A few years prior to that timeframe, ColdFusion had great market share in both enterprise and Windows.  A few years after that, .NET became dominant after ASP, but the core three were still more or less the same.  Ruby might have chipped away at PHP, but clearly that never overtook it.

Python was kind of ""just around.""  Plone was its only killer app, but it kept it alive.  CMS was a big enterprise need that didn't have an elegant solution, and so people were trying everything.  Google was using it for a lot of scientific research and from there, it crept into the research world, because the syntax is easy, where it got a stranglehold.  (Just five years ago, I was working at a bioresearch lab, and I can't tell you how much bad Python 2.7 was still around.). Being in research, it serendipitously positioned itself into the math and AI boom that we're in today, and it's everywhere.

So basically, Plone and Google kept it alive long enough for dumb luck to take over and show people how good it was.  Otherwise, I think it'd just be another niche academic language.",2023-04-09 22:33:38,3,380he,snapetom

It was public bidding and a paper-intensive process; we delivered them a 200 pages proposal. We got invited to the steering committee meeting who was deciding who will get the project.

They asked the questions

- What is Python

- Does it run on Java

- Does it use Oracle database

It was a trip wasted, not to mention the work to put the proposal together.

We did not get the project. A lot of things have improved in 20 years, but this was the atmosphere of 90s and early 00s. In 00s Linux started to become popular and in 10s Python and JavaScript both become ""professional grade"" languages.

After dealing with software for a couple of decades I believe it all boils down the trust and awareness. It needs to work and it needs to work for many years before people can put their trust in it.

Trend 2: killer data science features caused the final explosion. Sklearn had an big overtime impact on machine learning that literally was not as well executed in any other languages. R was piece meal. C++ was comically complicated. Etc. Then came deep learning and Google again pushed python way out to the lead on deep learning with tensorflow. There were competitors but there's no doubt in my mind who won.  Keras simplified it for the masses. If r had been the stand out deep learning platform early. I dunno what happens to history.

jfl9sap,12glkw4,t3_12glkw4,"Multiple reasons, here's the timeline that I recall:

   * mid-90s:  many (most?) programmers weren't yet sold on interpreted languages and dynamic typing yet.  VB was useful, but wasn't well-respected, perl was mostly for reporting or other small utilities, and rexx was super-cool, but didn't have a huge reputation on unix & windows.
   * late-90s: Perl established the legitimacy of interpreted languages for backend application development.  Few people had heard of python by this time. 
   * early-00s: many people started looking for a light-weight alternative to the heavy boilerplate of Java and something more readable, and with stricter tyuping than Perl - and started using Python. Python was very capable, jython looked promising.  Given that the Perl community really made the case for interpreted languages to be taken seriously - there was an *enormous* amount of hostility towards Python from the Perl community.
   * late-00s: python's future seemed questionable given the enthusiasm and rapid growth of the ruby-community once rails took off.  Python's migration to v3 was a bit of disaster but it finally hit the tipping point fairly suddenly right at the middle of the decade which really opened it up for growth.
   * 10s: data science began taking off and python was the preferred language, python got picked up by a lot of schools, ruby declined, and the trajectory was set.

1. Python 1 was primitive. It wasn't much better than perl, and worse in some ways. Missing basics like classes. So many looked, and moved on, for quite a while
2. Performance was and is $hit, comparatively. It needed hardware to catch up to make it's absolute performance acceptable for many purposes.
3. Library {standard and otherwise} needed a while to build. General purpose languages need a large library to become effective for general use. No one wants to deal with raw sockets every time you need to connect to a network resource, etc. 

There was clearly a need for better options at the time.
Matlab was rapidly gaining in popularity in 1994, esp for numeric programming: Python has largely supplanted it for many purposes. 
Java was cross platform, intended to be a gp Lang for many things (though not scripting) 
C# doomed as win only

Python's ability to move from simple, interpreted, but complete scripting lang , all the way to large complex application is fairly unique.

I've been blogging since 2018 and it made me a total of 5$ (\~3$ after tax, someone bought me a coffee since I shared some HackTheBox solutions on my blog).

The course income depends on your course rating, topic and how many sales you can generate. If you refer people to the course you'll get 97% of the course price, if Udemy promotes the course and makes a sale you'll get 30%. For the FastAPI topic, the median monthly revenue is 100$ and top revenue is 1700$. I've made around double the median and I'm expecting the revenue to drop since last ratings I received weren't that good.

C++ code can be thread-safe (if using mutexes), so it can be used to share state across the interpreters.
Previously, doing the same thing across processes was massively more complicated -- all shared data needed to be allocated in shared memory sections, which means simple C++ types like `std::string` couldn't be used. Also the normal C++ `std::mutex` can't synchronize across different processes.

So effectively, if you had an existing thread-safe C++ library and wanted to use it concurrently from multiple Python threads, you were forced to choose between:

1) run everything in one process, with the GIL massively limiting the possible concurrency

2) Use multiprocessing run a separate copy of the C++ library in each process. This multiplies our memory consumption (for us, that's often ~15GB) with the number of cores (so keeping a modern CPU busy would take 480GB of RAM)

3) Essentially re-write the C++ library to use custom allocators and custom locks everywhere, so that it can place the 15 GB data in shared memory.

Now with Python 3.12 with GIL-per-subinterpreter, I think we'll finally be able to use all CPU cores concurrently without massively increasing our memory usage or C++ code complexity.",2023-04-08 19:34:08,3,a98vj,kniy

To me, it adds mostly syntactic sugar (it is as strictly required as a docstring, at least for now) at the cost of reducing considerably readability and conciseness, both of which are staples of Python and always cited among the reasons of its success.

If typing is really that useful, then why roleplaying typed languages instead of going all the way through?

One potential advantage I see is that typing can be a way to embed some sort of online testing in the code that even a linter might do. However, it can't replace actual testing, so... A glorified guideline?

I used to be a maintainer for a 200 kloc python codebase. It was well over a decade old and developed by dozens of people across about a dozen companies. A project of that scale needs to very explicitly declare interfaces otherwise it becomes nearly impossible to reason about the codebase. Specifically, having well specified return types means that forgetting to handle None-returns is not an issue anymore. 

The overhead of reading generic syntax, like “this function takes an iterator of T and a function that takes T and returns U, returning an iterator of U”, is nothing compared to trying to figure that out from reading the function or explaining it in a doc comment. The first few times you see it it does take a bit longer, but that goes away. 

Python will likely never have a strong enough type system to replace all testing. However, it can replace some testing when combined with mypy. If your types are well specified, you can throw out all the tests around “Does this function do the right thing if I give it the wrong types?”, “Does this function handle None?”, etc. If you start to use prototypes and generic constraints, you can use mypy to check that you are composing correctly. 

The big advantages is for IDEs and tooling. The TypeVar approach is a nightmare for tools to handle. Being able to get “this function takes T and U and returns T” from the signature should help speed up things quite a bit. 

In the future, I could see mypy being integrated into python and allowing an opt-in “strict typing” mode which increases startup time but allows python to generate better machine code or just automatically create the guard code for incorrect types for you. Alternatively, this would open up ahead of time compilation, which might enable you to figure out everything in interpreted mode then compile for production.",2023-04-08 15:13:28,4,2uuylk7f,lightmatter501
jfexckg,12f3glm,t1_jfes1jp,"The core answer for me is if I could replace python with statically typed similarish language with same library ecosystem I likely would. Python is used by many groups for variety of reasons. I work on large production numerical/ml libraries in python. Python dominates ml ecosystem and most other languages are worth little consideration for products that use deep learning. At same time typing is still very useful as both form of documentation and for making refactors/changes in large codebases safer.

As for your linter point I value linters strongly. My current codebase requires code to lint check, pass documentation rules, pass type checker, and test coverage rules. Type checking does not replace testing. I consider it to be stronger then typical linter and both linters/type checkers I find very valuable in refactors and following larger codebases 

I think this feature does make following generics a good deal more straight forward. The current way of doing it makes generic methods of class very ambiguous and easy to confuse generic function in a class vs generic class’s function which look almost same but mean two different things. Python is also rather weird in that almost no other language with generic has comparable syntax today. I’ve coded in bunch of languages to some degree and can’t think of any language with similar way of doing generics as python for defining type variables. I think for developers that write generic functions new syntax will be more friendly to use and follow.

Lastly I would not consider conciseness a goal of python. The new syntax is more concise then existing way of defining TypeVar for 1 function but even if it mildly longer that would not be main consideration for me. There are parts of python that look like pseudo code but there are many ways it does not optimize for conciseness like custom operators. Haskell is much more concise and dense language used by a couple companies.

The [examples](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/#summary-examples) section of the PEP is a great summary. We no longer have to declare `TypeVar`, nor do we have to specify the variance.

jfrjez3,12ha6mc,t1_jfqkxfk,"TL;DR:

A linter is a tool that checks your code for mistakes and style issues. PyLint, Flake8, Black, and Blue are popular Python linters. Ruff is a new tool that can replace multiple linters (and also soon [format your code like Black/Blue](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1904).


Long form:
A linter is a tool that analyzes your code for potential errors, bugs, and stylistic issues (like [black](https://github.com/psf/black). It checks your code against a bunch of rules someone made (like Black, that is PEP8 compliant)

In Python, there are several popular linters such as PyLint, Flake8, and Black. These linters perform various checks on your code, including syntax errors, variable names, code formatting, and code complexity.

- PyLint analyzes your Python code for errors and style issues, and assigns a score based on the quality of your code.
- Flake8 checks your code for style issues, syntax errors, and potential bugs.
- Black and Blue are Python code formatters that automatically reformats your code 
- MyPy, while not a linter in the traditional sense, focuses specifically on type-checking and does not perform general code quality checks like PyLint or Flake8.

What's interesting is not just Ruff's ability to outperform many of these tools, but its ability to take your pipeline of 5+ tools to do these things and use one thing (Ruff) instead.

Ruff is also aspiring to be a code formatter like Black/Blue with some configuration allowed. So, maybe soon, we can see another tool replaced by Ruff :) (https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1904)",2023-04-11 00:02:55,2,jlklb3zi,monorepo

I try to be clear and honest about Ruff's strengths and weaknesses -- there are some cursory answers in the [FAQ](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/#how-does-ruff-compare-to-flake8) RE comparisons to other tools -- but since the article mostly talked strengths, I'm happy to suggest a few ""reasons not to use Ruff"". I think about them a lot :)

1. **No support for custom rules or plugins.** This is Ruff's biggest limitation right now. E.g., Flake8 has a robust plugin system, so anyone can extend Flake8 with custom rules. Ruff doesn't support that. (I'd like to support plugins in the future, but we're not working on it right now.)
2. **""Less powerful"" static analysis.** Compared to Pylint, Ruff is ""less powerful"" right now. It doesn't look across files, it can't catch things like ""wrong number of arguments provided to a function"", it doesn't really do any branch analysis, and so on. It's similar to Flake8, in that way. I'm certain that Ruff will improve here, but if you straight-up replace Pylint with Ruff, you might feel like you're missing certain kinds of analyses that Ruff can't yet support.
3. **Less stable / more churn.** We still haven't published a ""stable release"". We're on version 0.0.260 or so. To be honest, we used to be a little more brazen about publishing breaking changes -- now that we have a bunch of projects relying on us, we're pretty careful and hesitant. But, it's true that you'd expect a tool like Flake8 or Pylint that's been around for years to give you less churn on configuration, diagnostics, etc.
4. **You're happy with your linter.** If Ruff's strengths don't resonate with you, that's of course fine too. (Although you might be surprised. I think there are a lot of happy Ruff users who wouldn't have expected a ""faster linter"" to be impactful to them before they tried Ruff.)

I hope that the hype around Ruff is just a sign that we're building something people like to use (though in reality I'm sure it's also luck). I get a ton of motivation out of reading comments like those in this thread.

Sounds grumpy but that's not wrong. Ruff ending up as more notorious than Mypy is plain weird.

I tried to use the vscode extension but it was so poorly documented I couldn’t make sense of the configs. Getting it working properly with the same config used in my pre-commit hook was difficult enough it was easier for me to just uninstall and go with a more well supported linter. It’s more important to me that it’s stable, well documented and easy to use than infinitely configurable and fast.

* It brings all of the functionality of flake8, isort, pyupgrade, and dozens of other tools into one tool. It's still faster than any one of those tools, and it's only one dependency.
* The maintainer seems like a pleasant person who's willing to work with the community and enjoys what he's doing. Look through the issue tracker on flake8. 90% of them are closed and locked to contributors after a single reply of ""use the issue tracker"". When you google a problem you're having with flake8, the most likely top result is a closed issue that just says ""you clearly didn't search the issue tracker"". They clearly don't actually want to work on their own software, which I think drives people away. Charlie on the other hand is releasing several times a week and actively engaging on trying to solve issues without writing people off or shutting them down.
* Related to the last one, flake8 has some issues that they won't fix seemingly just out of stubbornness, regardless of how much of a problem they cause to the community.
   * They refuse to support pyproject.toml configuration despite overwhelming desire for it, and shut down threads for it with ""search the issue tracker"". The issue that explains their reasoning is copied from gitlab and near impossible to follow. 
   * They also pinned their dependency on importlib-metadata to < 4.3  for years for what was as far as I could tell a petty personal vendetta.

Pylint was an option, but the configuration experience was pretty terrible.

Enter ruff: it gives us the simplicity of flake8, plus the features we didn’t know we want - speed, no plugins necessary, pyproject.toml config, and a welcoming maintainer who’s open to change.

Will I like a song based on its melody?

Is this an upbeat or relaxing song?

Will this song make me happy or sad?

What artists are similar to the artists I like?

How? Well you have to a little work before you can train a NN to categorize the above examples. You’d need an answer key so that the algorithm can “learn” what the right answers are, and then can extrapolate it’s results into data it’s never seen before. 

Since this is a Python library, PyTorch could probably get the job done.",2023-04-06 22:02:12,1,p7mid,Caveman112233

You can scrape anything if you put your mind to it.  I have resorted to wgetting the source and extracting the data from that if the site is complaining about no javascript.  Or even screenshot the page and OCR.

Put in a few hours coding a decent bit scraping with Python and you'll come away knowing a hell lot more about programming, HTML, and that.

jf4epr1,12cgplg,t1_jf20wjj,"My first project was a scraper. Wrote my own library for it to learn requests and text manipulation. Then, I had to do another and another. I’m probably just gonna re-learn BeautifulSoup cuz it’s so recurring. For why, I’d say they fall into a few categories:

1. I wanted a copy of all the best submissions and comments on my favorite tech site (Lobste.rs) at one point. That was originally to experiment with better search features using local software. A third-party site with same content might facilitate better searching. Or ranking, curation, etc.

2. Many sites are bloated. They can be slow at home. My job now puts me on the worst, mobile connection in the area. Like pi-hole or UBlock Origin, a scraper can let me get just what I need, transform it into a compact view, and send it over weak connection.

3. Related is bypassing buggy UI. One example is BibleGateway which I pay for to use with my sites (see profile). I needed Spanish verses since I was serving Hispanic community, too. It had some feature that gives you all English or all Spanish translations if you ever pick one. Hard to go back. On such sites, it’s easier to use a URL generator to reliably get to content you want. I also scraped out and spliced the key content into a minimalist, HTML page served over Flask. Got *way* faster!

4. That brings us to custom UI’s. One of old concepts for Web 3.0 was the provide data, we connect to it, and transform and view it however we want. You can approximate this with scraping combined with console, GUI, or web libraries. 

5. Old one is getting pricing and availability of something across markets. Comparison shopping. Many stores seem to realize making that easy, like with an API, can lead people to competition’s better deals. Others have restrictive API’s but no restrictions on main site. You might have to custom-make scrapers for sites that didn’t try to present the info in a machine readable way. You can also sell or trade on this kind of info.

6. Site uptime monitor. Scrapers can make for a basic monitor. You don’t need to know networking.

I'm building a journaling app for high schoolers, and I think it would be really cool to have something similar. They enter their activity for the day and that data is sent to an AI api with a request to write a journal entry about what they accomplished that day in the voice of a person who is determined to live a healthy and fulfilled life by leaving a positive impact on the world. They then use that journal entry as a starter paragraph for a free-flow journaling session.   


The app will send weekly charts showing their adherence to positive habits and other metrics, but seeing this got me thinking that it would be cool to have something similar to analyze their free-flow sessions and compare it to things like what activities they are doing, etc.
